<p>
  Hey! My name is Pavlo Sirous (but you can call me Paul without any doubts since that's actually equivalents). 
  I am a professional Ruby-on-Rails freelance web developer based in Kharkov, Ukraine, Eastern Europe (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com.ua/maps/place/Kharkiv,+Kharkiv+Oblast/@48.5152658,33.2183808,5z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4127a09f63ab0f8b:0x2d4c18681aa4be0a?hl=en">see on map</a>).
  I speak three languages: English, Russian and, of course, Ukrainian.
  I have accumulated some unique experience that I'm going to share here.

  I know three languages: English, Russian and, of course, Ukrainian.
  For more than 4 years I work hard to helping small companies and startups build their online products.
  I love what I do and trying to keep myself updated to the latest news
  and trends from the world of people and tools related to my proficiency.
