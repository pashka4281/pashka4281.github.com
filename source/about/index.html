As a result, he’s both made great contributions to building the product and has himself grown professionally.  On many occasions, when Paul encountered previously unfamiliar technologies, such as Angular.js and APIs for payment processors, he eagerly took on the challenge and quickly became proficient.Many hard core developers I know are reluctant to touch the front end.  But not Paul.  He fearlessly dove into our challenges with a fully responsive UI/UX.  There were times when our project lacked a standalone front end developer and Paul bailed us out.  He’s certainly earned the right to be labeled a strong full-stack developer.  I hope to continue working with Paul in the future.</p></div><div class=\"recommendation\">  <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mprx/0_OVJogBrEFzK_2oC2YgMMgqFe5ALG2712pYDvgqnvsBA-1IXutpd61NGUwp5j7e-h0JRqtPHZ0KP_\">  <hgroup>    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickcogley\" target=\"_blank\">Rick Cogley</a>    <h5>Ask me about Japan project success.

I really appreciate his quality work, help and moreover, patience.</p></div><div class=\"recommendation\">  <img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mprx/0_z4FpDFhk00p07PLwBZ9_Dkv5xjEKf9zwcy1_Dk-Z8UY8rtGIMOcr_XQnlro7uAqbqRLGGiuBYGX3\">  <hgroup>    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/anthony-duran/54/126/76a\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Duran</a>    <h5>UX Designer at Symbiosis</h5>  </hgroup>  <p style=\"clear: left;\">In addition to being a great asset as an RoR developer, Paul contributed to our team by tackling front-end challenges and integrations.
