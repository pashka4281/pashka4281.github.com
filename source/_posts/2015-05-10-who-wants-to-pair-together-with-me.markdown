This days I do lot's of pair programming with my friend developer for projects we both work on. 
This is really cool stuff that works great for small distributed teams. What does it do? It helps to improve quality of code, a lot.
<!-- More -->
Our usual stack looks like this:

* VIM
* Wemux
* Pair server
* SSH/Mosh

Apart from work week I have some free time on weekend that I can spend to extend my own vision, looking at your way of thinking. 
So let's pair together on something.

Drop a comment to arrange common available time (you can use this tool to do it in a fancy way heh

**Attention!! Basic knowledge of vim required (at least moving around)
