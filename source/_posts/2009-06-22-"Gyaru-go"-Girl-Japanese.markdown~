**Mezamashi TV** had a segment on the lastest **gyaru** language. If you're not familiar, gyaru are the sort of schoolgirls who hang out in Shibuya or Harajuku, dress in the latest fashion and speak in a sort of code. Here's the three I remember: 



**ムカTK mukaTK** - mukatsuku, to be pissed off. The original's just as easy, ladies.

**モレる moreru** - um, to be dressed up, with your hair in a bun with cute accessories. Comes from "moritsukeru" to decorate. 

**シカメ shikame** - from shikato and meeru, ignore mail. To have blown off answering someone's text message. I hear that a large percentage of schoolkids get really stressed about "shikame", in all seriousness. 



At any rate, remembering these is one thing, but using them is another, so remember this: if an "oyaji" (middle-aged guy) like me uses gyaru-go, he's **ostracized** by his daughters and subjected to the "**uzai**" label for all time. :-)
