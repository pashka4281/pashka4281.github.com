[{% img right http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2479/3641719587_d9ceb034ff_m.jpg '' 'Drop - Toilet Paper Horror' %}](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3641719587 "View 'Drop - Toilet Paper Horror' on Flickr.com")"**Drop**" is a horror story novella written by _Koji Suzuki_, the writer of best-selling horror stories such as "Ring" and "Rasen" (Spiral). Suzuki san was born in 1957 in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, and his books have sold more than 8 million copies. 


Thing is, Drop's not your run-of-the-mill novella; it's printed on toilet paper. The Japanese summer is a time for telling horror stories around a campfire or watching the annual scary TV shows, and many Japanese horror stories are set in toilets, so it's quite fitting that there be a horror story written right _on_ your toilet paper, actually. 


Drop is produced by [Hayashi Paper](http://www.hayashi-paper.com/contents/pick-up/drop.html), and can be purchased in Japan via [Banbix](http://www.banbix.com/drop.htm). A case of 24 rolls of Drop toilet paper costs JPY 2400 before tax. Banbix says they don't accept orders from or ship outside of Japan, so you're SOL even if you _can_ read it. 


Drop is enough to scare the crap out of you, literally, and I'd want my own roll to be able to finish the thing uninterrupted. Either way, stay clear of the toilets in Japan, and have a scary summer. :-)
