[{% img right http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3346/3593964582_d4a38afc5b_m.jpg '' 'Oshogatsu Peace!' %}](http://www.flickr.com/photos/81796435@N00/3593964582 "View 'Oshogatsu Peace!' on Flickr.com")Every year, **we have a family reunion** during the New Year holiday "_oshogatsu_". The photo in this post is of the 2009 edition. 


This is A Big Deal for the family here, and they do it without fail. Missing it is also A Big Deal, so I think we've missed it once in the past 15 years. I gather it's an Asian thing to have these big family gatherings, but I always feel like the odd man out, when the conversation turns to whatever it is that 60-ish-year-old Japanese folks like to talk about. 


Though I enjoy the company and drink and food, great food, these also make me long for home, to see my Mom and Dad, Sister and Brother and everyone's families and friends. Ah, _if only_ Star Trek teleportation was possible! Oshogatsu omedeto!
